## GraphQL quick start

A simple GraphQL quick start using the GrahQL.js binding. It creates the schema
with a custom type, defines the resolver to return the fake data that conforms
to the schema, then use the graphql node command line tool to query the data in
a partial way, which shows the power of GrahQL.
